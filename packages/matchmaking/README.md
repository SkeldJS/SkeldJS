## @skeldjs/matchmaking

This package contains a way to search for games hosted locally for the SkeldJS client. While you can install it on its own with `npm install --save @skeldjs/matchmaking` or `yarn add @skeldjs/matchmaking`, it is one package of a bigger project, [skeldjs](https://github.com/skeldjs/SkeldJS).
